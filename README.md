## Services & Widget

3 services are available on Amadeus:
 - A weather service,
 - A covid service, and
 - An anime service (anilist)

Every service needs an API key to work properly. Api keys can be setup in the configuration file `appsettings.json` or by
specifing those environement variables:
 - WEATHERCONFIGURATION__APIKEY
 - COVIDCONFIGURATION__APIKEY
 - ANILISTOPTIONS__CLIENTID
 - ANILISTOPTIONS__CLIENTSECRET

The weather api key needs to be generated from [here](https://www.weatherapi.com/my/).
The covid api key from [here](https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data/).
And the anilist id and secrets from [here](https://anilist.co/home). During the configuration of this client, you need
to specify this url as the redirect url: http://localhost:8081/login/anilist
